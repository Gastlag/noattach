	<a href="/">noatta.ch</a> is made by
	<a href="http://spaceboyz.net/~astro/">Astro</a>.
	The code is open source on Github: <a href="https://github.com/astro/noattach">github.com/astro/noattach</a>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <ol class="box">
	<li>You get a random link that you can share privately with
	  your friends.</li>
	<li>Browsing to that URL establishes a real-time connection.</li>
	<li>You instantly see what others share.</li>
	<li>When you add a new file, its file name and size will be
	  broadcasted over the noatta.ch server to any other people
	  visiting your URL.</li>
	<li>Downloading is a simple HTTP request to the server.</li>
	<li>The server will then individually tell the browser that
	  shares the file to upload a chunk of it.</li>
	<li>After passing it to the downloader, it will continuously
	  ask the sharer to pass the next chunk until end of file.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p class="box">
	There are dropboxen and share hosters, but often, you'll want to
	share files only once, temporarily, with a limited set of
	recipients. That's what <strong>noatta.ch</strong> is made for: just point your
	browser at <a href="http://noatta.ch/">http://noatta.ch/</a> and
	pass the new URL to the people you want to share with.
      </p>

      <h2>Browser support?</h2>
      <p class="box">
	On-demand sharing requires
	the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=fileapi">File API</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Does it cost money?</h2>
      <p class="box">
	This site is running on a free Joyent
	SmartMachine. <strong>.ch</strong> domains are quite
	pricy. Support me for this project:
