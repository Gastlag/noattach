      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
      There are dropboxen and share hosters, but often, you'll want to
      share files only once, temporarily, with a limited set of
      recipients. That's what noatta.ch is made for: just point your
      browser at <a href="http://noatta.ch/">http://noatta.ch/</a> and
      pass the the new URL to the people you want to share with.
      </p>

      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
      The server side runs on Node.js, together with Connect as the
      HTTP middleware. Communication is leveraged by Socket.io, but
      uploads are fairly normal XMLHttpRequests (AJAX) using the
      latest features (sendAsBinary &amp; upload events).
      </p>

      <h2>Browser support?</h2>
      <p>
      On-demand sharing requires the <a
      href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=fileapi">File API</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>It crashed my browser!</h2>
      <p>
      If you're sharing big files with many people I recommend good
      old BitTorrent.
      </p>

      <h2>IP addresses?</h2>
      <p>
      Before any authority demands permanent logging of the metadata I
      want to auto-expose evil people. You've got nothing to fear if
      you're sharing temporarily with a limited set of recipients.
      </p>

      <h2>Why target="_blank"?</h2>
      <p>
      I saw it as the only reliable way to keep the page open when
      clicking on downloads.
      </p>
      
      <h2>¥€$!</h2>
      <p>
      Luckily I've got a coupon code for the brand new <a
      href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> Node.js hosting. Other than
      that, .ch domains are quite pricy. Support me for this project:
